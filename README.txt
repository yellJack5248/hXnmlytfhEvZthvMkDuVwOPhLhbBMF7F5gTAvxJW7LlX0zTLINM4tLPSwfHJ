## Reflection

I worked on this lab alone, and I found it relatively easy to finish the lab 
because I already knew what to do for the lab. I simply had to write to 
STDOUT_FILENO and read from STDIN_FILENO. I could have stopped with only 
about 50 lines of code, but I wanted my code to be cleaner, so I make many 
formatting changes including headers and even prompted the user for a file 
name if the user inputted an invalid name, but I decided to remove that 
functionality to keep the program simpler. I remember wishing I didn't 
procrastinate on a project, but I was able to finish this project comfortably.
